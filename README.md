- 👋 Hello, I’m @CGlinka95 AKA Christopher Glinka,
- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming, Web Design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Graphic Design, Game Development, Writing, and LEARNING!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything mentioned prior to this line, I essentially never stop. There is always something new to discover and I LOVE it! 
      I have a BoA degree in English and Psychology from Concordia University of Edmonton, and am currently studying at NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology) to become a Computer Software Developer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything (within my skillset)! Bear in mind, I am still new to many things, so everything will be a work in progress. 
- 📫 I can be reached at glinkachris@gmail.com, I check my emails daily, or on Discord at CG#7582
